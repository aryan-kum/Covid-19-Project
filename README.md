# Covid-19-Project



I used replit.com for this project as I needed a hosting service for my project to work and you can import bottle on replit where you can host your website for free. For the project, I learned about the concept of frontend and backend programming. I used python for backend and Javascript/JS Node/HTML/CSS for frontend. JSON was also used for the frontend data to be converted to usable data for backend processing.

I made a dynamic website which would plot graphs after reading data from a CSV file grabbed from CDC website about vaccinations. I had 2 static graphs that would be plotted as soon as the user visited the website and one dynamic graph which would depend on the state user chose to see the data of. I used plotly in Javascript/JS Node to plot all these graphs and modules, such as csv, in python to be able to read the file extracted from CDC website.
